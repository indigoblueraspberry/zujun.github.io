<p><b>Talk title: Single-molecule long-read sequencing reveals the chromatin basis of gene expression.</b></p>
</div>
<table> 
	
	<tr><td>Our genome has different levels of organization, and at the nucleosome level, DNA strands wrap around protein cores like beads on a string. Positioning of these nucleosomes and changes in chromatin status play important regulatory roles in gene expression. Our new method, MeSMLR-seq, aims to resolve the long-range dynamics that remain poorly understood at the single-molecule level. Briefly, two examples from the paper in Genome Research are discussed: 1) MeSMLR-seq can resolve differential nucleosome organization principles at the transcription start site of silent versus active genes; and 2) MeSMLR-seq can explore the coupled chromatin status of adjacent genes during transcriptional reprogramming. These methods offer promising utility to study multiple layers of epigenetics simultaneously.

	<p><b>Reported by F1000 Prime:</b>
	<tr><td>Combining methyltransferase treatment with nanopore sequencing, Wang et al. developed a new experimental approach “MeSMLR-seq” to map nucleosome occupancy and chromatin accessibility at single long DNA molecules. MeSMLR-seq shows consistent bulk-cell results with existing methods (e.g. MNase-seq and ATAC-seq), but more importantly it brings unprecedented power to capture the single-molecule epigenome. Thus, epigenome heterogeneity can be clearly resolved and subtle but meaningful epigenome differences at single molecules can be discovered. For instance, the MeSMLR-seq data provided the quantitative evidence for the correlation between promoter accessibility and transcription activity. The MeSMLR-seq long reads phased >300 nucleosomes and identified chromatin accessibility of up to 40 adjacent genes simultaneously at single molecules - e.g. the MeSMLR-seq data revealed the coupled chromatin status changes of the adjacent glucose transporter genes responding to the glucose concentration changes. It shows potential to study the association of multiple layers of epigenomes, including base modifications at the same molecules.

	<tr><td>Genome-wide chromatin accessibility and nucleosome occupancy profiles have been widely investigated, while the long-range dynamics remains poorly studied at the single-cell level. Here we present a new experimental approach MeSMLR-seq (methyltransferase treatment followed by single-molecule long-read sequencing) for long-range mapping of nucleosomes and chromatin accessibility at single DNA molecules, and thus achieve comprehensive-coverage characterization of the corresponding heterogeneity. MeSMLR-seq offers direct measurements of both nucleosome-occupied and nucleosome-evicted regions on a single DNA molecule, which is challenging for many existing methods. We applied MeSMLR-seq to haploid yeast, where single DNA molecules represent single cells, and thus we could investigate the combinatorics of many (up to 356) nucleosomes at long range in single cells. We illustrated the differential organization principles of nucleosomes surrounding the transcription start site for silently- and actively-transcribed genes, at the single-cell level and in the long-range scale...

	<tr><td>Third-generation sequencing technologies have advanced the progress of the biological research by generating reads that are substantially longer than second-generation sequencing technologies. However, their notorious high error rate impedes straightforward data analysis and limits their application. A handful of error correction methods for these error-prone long reads have been developed to date. The output data quality is very important for downstream analysis, whereas computing resources could limit the utility of some computing-intense tools. There is a lack of standardized assessments for these long-read error-correction methods. </td>

	<tr><td>Junctophilin-2 (JP2) is a structural protein required for normal excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. After cardiac stress, JP2 is cleaved by the calcium ion-dependent protease calpain, which disrupts the E-C coupling ultrastructural machinery and drives heart failure progression. We found that stress-induced proteolysis of JP2 liberates an N-terminal fragment (JP2NT) that translocates to the nucleus, binds to genomic DNA, and controls expression of a spectrum of genes in cardiomyocytes. Transgenic overexpression of JP2NT in mice modifies the transcriptional profile, resulting in attenuated pathological remodeling in response to cardiac stress. Conversely, loss of nuclear JP2NT function accelerates stress-induced development of hypertrophy and heart failure in mutant mice. These data reveal a self-protective mechanism in failing cardiomyocytes that transduce mechanical information (E-C uncoupling) into salutary transcriptional reprogramming in the stressed heart.

	<tr><td>We address the problem of observing personal diploid methylomes, CpG methylome pairs of homologous chromosomes that are distinguishable with respect to phased heterozygous variants (PHVs), which is challenging due to scarcity of PHVs in personal genomes. Single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing is promising as it outputs long reads with CpG methylation information, but a serious concern is whether reliable PHVs are available in erroneous SMRT reads with an error rate of ∼15%. To overcome the issue, we propose a statistical model that reduces the error rate of phasing CpG site to 1%, thereby calling CpG hypomethylation in each haplotype with >90% precision and sensitivity. Using our statistical model, we examined GNAS complex locus known for a combination of maternally, paternally, or biallelically expressed isoforms, and observed allele-specific methylation pattern almost perfectly reflecting their respective allele-specific expression status, demonstrating the merit of elucidating comprehensive personal diploid methylomes and transcriptomes.

We carried out single cell expression profiling of 241 individual cells recovered from 32 human embryos during the early and late stages of viable human blastocyst (VHB) differentiation. Classification of embryonic cells was performed solely based on expression patterns of human pluripotency-associated transcripts (HPAT), which represent a family of primate-specific transposable element-derived lincRNAs highly expressed in human embryonic stem cells and regulating nuclear reprogramming and pluripotency induction...		</td>

	<tr><td>The intra-tumor heterogeneity is associated with cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, such as in breast cancer. While the existing methods for studying tumor heterogeneity only analyze variant allele frequency (VAF), the genotype of variant is also informative for inferring subclones, which can be detected by long reads or paired-end reads. We developed GenoClone to integrate VAF with the genotype of variant innovatively, so it showed superior performance of inferring the number of subclones, estimating the fractions of subclones and identifying somatic single-nucleotide variants composition of subclones. When GenoClone was applied to 389 TCGA breast cancer samples, it revealed extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity. We further found that a few somatic mutations were relevant to the late stage of tumor evolution, including the ones at the oncogene PIK3CA and the tumor suppress gene TP53. Moreover, 52 subclones that were identified from 167 samples shared high similarity of somatic mutations, which were clustered into three groups with the sizes of 24, 14 and 14...
